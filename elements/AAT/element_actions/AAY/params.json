Note that it comes like this: \"//aws.com/23892378/filename\" (without quotes) so you must append the https: or http: for it to work as a link when displaying. But I suggest you to save it in that original state, Bubble apparently uses it as it is for some things. When that event is triggered, the PDF will already be uploaded to your app's storage and the link will be in the PDF Model element custom state called \"Saved PDF's URL\". Note that it will be available in the same \"PDF Model X\" element that was used to create the file.",
